# Neurobiology-coursework

This repository contains several assignments from the final phase of my neurobiology undergraduate degree. These projects serve as the foundation for much of my later research, where I explore the ethical use of virtual reality to investigate naturalistic human behaviors. While my writing has evolved since completing these deliverables, I remain proud of the ideas they represent.

The repo is separated into two sections:
1) **Human and Animal Behavior**: This folder highlights the physical science behind behavior, with work in ethology, neurology, and endocrinology.
2) **NeuroPhilosophy**: This folder combines insights from physical science with philosophical inquiry into the brain and mind.

Among all the deliverables, my favorites are the **Neurobiology VR Grant Proposal** and the **Oceanic Experience** paper.

## Human and Animal Behavior

This folder includes:
- Two ethological assessments: the **Mockingbird Territory Map** and the **Squirrel Ethogram**.
- A the term paper from my Hormones and Behavior course: **Parallels between Zebrafish and Human Corticomotor Pathways**.
- The capstone project of my Neurobiology concentration: **Neurobiology VR Grant Proposal**.

### Ethology Work

Although these deliverables are among the earliest in my academic journey, they illustrate a profound philosophical concept: **behavior is the spacetime pattern of an organism**. Tools like the territory map and ethogram represent ways of **interviewing animals in their own language**—deciphering their motility patterns in response to environmental stimuli to understand their internal states.

This realization laid the groundwork for my later research. I began to see that this pattern recognition could be combined with psychology to analyze human behavior more deeply. However, I also recognized ethical challenges in observing humans naturalistically, which led me to identify video games as an optimal solution. Video games provide a non-invasive environment where competency cannot be faked, minimizing observer effects while maintaining informed consent. Altogether, my work in ethology forms the foundation of my broader goal: building a bridge between the subjective and objective.

### Parallels between Zebrafish and Human Corticomotor Pathways

This term paper delves into the striking similarities between zebrafish and human corticomotor pathways, emphasizing how their shared neural and endocrine mechanisms mediate stress-induced changes in motility. It explores how zebrafish, as a model organism, provide a manipulable and ethically sound platform for studying the interactions between stress hormones like cortisol and behavior. By bridging these parallels, the paper highlights the translational potential of zebrafish research, offering insights into the neural underpinnings of human stress responses. This work formed a critical foundation for my broader interest in understanding how motility patterns reflect internal cognitive and emotional states—an idea that would later inform my investigation of human behavior in virtual environments, where stress and decision-making can be observed ethically and with ecological validity.

### Neurobiology VR Grant Proposal

The capstone project of my neurobiology concentration, this grant proposal presents a novel framework for diagnosing schizophrenia using virtual reality. Combining principles from ethology, neuroendocrinology, and immersive technologies, the proposal describes how virtual environments can be utilized to ethically and ecologically replicate naturalistic behaviors. Central to the project is the idea of creating virtual spaces where participants' motility patterns—serving as proxies for cognitive and motivational states—can be objectively analyzed. This approach bridges the gap between traditional psychological constructs and the dynamic, real-world behaviors often missing from controlled experiments. By focusing on negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, the proposal outlines a paradigm that not only advances diagnostic techniques but also sets the stage for exploring the interplay between brain activity, decision-making, and behavior.

## NeuroPhilosophy

This folder showcases work from my Neurology and Philosophy course, reflecting the intersection of neuroscience and philosophy, as well as my evolving thoughts on consciousness and subjective experience. 
It includes:
 - **Brain Representation**: A paper exploring how neural structures create representations of internal and external stimuli, drawing on key philosophical debates and contemporary neuroscience research.
 - **Consciousness PowerPoint**: A presentation addressing philosophical issues surrounding consciousness, including the challenges posed by subjective experience and the explanatory gap.
 - **Oceanic Experience Term Paper**: A deep dive into the concept of oceanic experience, examining its philosophical and neurobiological dimensions to highlight the interplay between altered states of consciousness and brain function.
 - **Reflection on the Hard Problem of Consciousness**: A contemplative piece discussing the interdisciplinary approach to understanding the hard problem of consciousness, bridging neuroscience, philosophy, and subjective experience.

### Brain Representation

This paper explores the concept of representation in neuroscience, examining how the brain encodes internal and external stimuli to form perceptions of the world. Drawing on Patricia Churchland’s "Brain-Wise," the work delves into key evidence for representational processes, such as the role of hippocampal place cells, head-direction cells, and grid cells in spatial mapping. It also considers the theoretical framework of vector coding as a mechanism for efficient neural representation. Bridging neuroscience and philosophy, the paper highlights how advances in neural representation research illuminate the relationship between brain activity and subjective experience while acknowledging unresolved challenges, such as the quantum measurement problem and its implications for representation.

### Consciousness Powerpoint

This presentation explores philosophical and scientific challenges surrounding consciousness, focusing on the "Hard Problem" of explaining subjective experience. It examines key philosophical positions, including materialist views that link consciousness to physical processes and dualist perspectives emphasizing its non-physical nature. By addressing common objections, such as the limits of imaginability and the explanatory gap, the presentation argues for an interdisciplinary approach that integrates neuroscience, philosophy, and computational modeling. Ultimately, it highlights the complexity of consciousness and the need for collaborative efforts to bridge gaps between subjective experience and objective science.

### Interdisciplinary Approach to the Hard Problem of Consciousness

This reflection delves into the interdisciplinary approach to the **Hard Problem of Consciousness**, which questions how subjective experiences arise from physical processes in the brain. Drawing on insights from neuroscience, philosophy, and cognitive science, the paper examines existing theories, such as dualism, physicalism, and panpsychism, while critiquing their limitations in explaining the nature of qualia. It highlights the importance of bridging subjective and objective perspectives through integrative methodologies, emphasizing the need for conceptual and experimental innovation. Ultimately, the reflection suggests that progress lies in exploring new frameworks that connect neural dynamics with the experiential dimension, offering a potential roadmap for understanding consciousness. Unfortunately, I could not find the final version of this paper, so the one presented is a draft with suggested edits included.

### Oceanic Experience

This term paper explores the concept of **Oceanic Experience**, a profound state of unity and interconnectedness often associated with spiritual or transcendent moments. Through the lenses of neuroscience and philosophy, the paper examines the neural correlates of these experiences, drawing connections between altered brain states, such as those induced by meditation or psychedelics, and their phenomenological impact. It also critiques the challenges of studying such subjective states within a scientific framework, advocating for an interdisciplinary approach that integrates neurobiological data with philosophical inquiry. The paper underscores the significance of understanding Oceanic Experience not only as a window into human consciousness but also as a means of exploring the boundaries between self, other, and the broader universe.
